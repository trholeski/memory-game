Thank you for visiting the repo for my friends memory-game.

As you click images, they will randomize after each click.  For every image that you click, that you've not yet clicked, you will get one point added to your score.
If you click an image that you've already clicked in the round, you will lose and if your current score is the high score it will be saved for the remainder of your session.

Please enjoy yourself and good luck!
